# D3_Journalism

- Here I analyzed the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings.



- Created a scatter plot between all the data variables 

1. More Data, More Dynamics
Included more demographics and more risk factors, placed additional labels in the scatter plot and gave them click events so that users can decide which data to display. Animated the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes.

2. Incorporate d3-tip
Added tooltips to circles and displayed each tooltip with the data that has been selected.
